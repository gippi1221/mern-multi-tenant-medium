# Multi-Tenant MERN Stack — Medium Series Support Repo
This repository supports the Medium article series on building a multi-tenant application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with TypeScript and Docker.

The project is organized into incrementally numbered directories — each one matches the progress and scope of a specific article in the series. This makes it easy to follow along step-by-step, or jump into any section you're interested in.
